## General Battery Care {-}

- Aim to keep battery levels above 40\% and below 65\% when not in use.
- Avoid charging the batteries to max capacity unless you are going to fly within the next day.
- When done flying, always charge your batteries at least back up to storage level (40\%).
- Remove batteries from the aircraft when stored for an extended period.
- Never over-discharge your battery.
- Fully charge and discharge the battery at least once every three (3) months to maintain battery health.
- Do not place loose batteries on any conductive surfaces, such as metal tables.
- Batteries must be stored in climate-controlled storage when not in use.
- Do not expose batteries to excessive heat or humidity.
- Consider labeling/numbering batteries to document battery use. Rotate usage of batteries to minimize over or under-utilization.


## Using Batteries {-}

### Battery Inspection {-}

- Check battery voltage levels at least once a month when not in use.
- Check for bulging, swelling, or cracks in the battery casing.
- Check for signs of electrical arcing, such as burn marks or melted plastic around the battery terminals.
- Safely discard any battery showing any sign of damage or bulging.

### Preparing for Flight {-}

- When charging batteries, ensure that the charging location is clean, uncluttered, and well-ventilated.
- Do not stack chargers when charging or place batteries on the power adapter during charging.
- Do not leave batteries charging unattended.
- Do not charge batteries near flammable materials or on flammable surfaces.
- Plan to charge batteries no earlier than three (3) days before the flight.


### Immediately after Flight {-}

- Power off the aircraft completely before removing the battery.
- After removing a used battery, store the battery in a shaded but well-ventilated location.
- Never store a recently used and warm battery in an enclosed battery bag or UAS case.
- Document any performance issues immediately.





## Battery Travel {-}

- Always store batteries in a suitable container that can protect the battery from puncture impacts, prevent the battery from jostling loose, and protect the battery contacts from damage.
- Always store batteries in a temperature-controlled environment.

    - Do not leave batteries unattended in a hot car or trailer.

- Do not store a battery with metal components such as paperclips, screws, or metal nuts.
- Never transport a damaged battery or a battery with less than 5\% remaining unless in a suitable battery fire containment bag or storage.


## Battery Incidents {-}

- Do not use a battery involved in a serious crash or heavy impact.
- If a battery falls into the water with the aircraft during flight, take it out immediately and place it in a safe and open area.

    - Maintain a safe distance from the battery until it is completely dry.
    - Never use the battery again and dispose of the battery properly.
    - Do not use heat to dry batteries.
   
- Put out any battery fire using sand or a dry powder fire extinguisher.


## Battery Disposal {-}

- Do not dispose of batteries in regular trash receptacles.
- If able, safely de-energize batteries before storing and disposing of batteries.
- Dispose of batteries in accordance with UC Hazardous Waste procedures.
