# UAS and Equipment Management {-}

## Recommended Supplemental Equipment {-}

- Sunshade/screen for controller/tablet/phone
- Launchpads: 3-5 ft diameter, weighted rim or with stakes
- Cleaning brush
- Additional propellers, memory cards, USB cables
- Miniature toolkit - PH, FH, Hex (1.5mm for most DJI), miniature pick and hook


## Storage and Transportation {-}

- Always store the UAS and UAS equipment properly when not in use

    - UAS equipment must be stored in climate-controlled storage.
    - Do not expose to excessive heat or humidity

- Only use cases designed for UAS for transportation and storage
- Ensure that the transmitter antennas are properly secured during transit 
- Do not store loose objects in the same storage compartment as the UAS or transmitter

     - Segregate loose objects, such as USB cables and toolkits, to a separate pouch or compartment

## Aircraft Maintenance {-}

- All UAS must be kept in an airworthy condition
- All maintenance must be logged (Example Table - Appendix~\ref{ap:maintenance_log})
- Check for firmware updates the day before any flight operations.

    - Do not rely on firmware update alerts
    - Turn on the UAS and transmitter, connect to the internet, and go to settings to check for updates
    - Some UAS will require firmware updates for camera gimbals and each battery

- Never handle the UAS when the propellers are in motion. 

    - If testing equipment or firmware status without intent for flight, remove propellers before turning the unit on


## In-Field Guidance {-}

- Always use a landing pad to keep the UAS free of dirt/dust during takeoff and landing
- Always brush dirt and debris from the camera, gimbal, and motors after every flight
- Keep the UAS and transmitter in the shade or out of direct sunlight when not in use
- Budget time to let the motors cool out of direct sunlight between flight operations



## Maintenance Log (Example) {-}

|	Date  | Name | UAS | Maintenance | Notes  | 
| ----- | ---- | ---- | :---- | :---- |
|	7-12-2020  | Bill Smith | FA0000000 | Replaced front left propeller \& hub crack | keep eye on other propellers | 
|       |      |      |             |       |
